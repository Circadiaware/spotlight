1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Stephen Larroque: So, something I say
sometimes is that I'm living outside of time.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,820
Hella Kemper: This is Stephen Larroque.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:13,720
HK: He says of himself that he lives outside
of time, which sounds kind of mysterious, Nina.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,880
Nina Lennartz: Yes, mysterious,
but also complicated and painful.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:28,640
SL: Outside of school I had no activities, because it was
very stressful to go to school all the time at a fixed time.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,840
NL: Larroque is telling us here how exhausting it was
for him to go to school at the same time every day.

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,720
NL: It took all his strength.

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:43,100
SL: Because of that, I used all my
energy and health to just go to school.

9
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,100
SL: And outside of
school there's nothing.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,340
SL: I had no life beyond.

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:57,180
NL: That was because his circadian rhythm, his inner
sleep-wake rhythm, was not in sync with the rest of the world.

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:03,180
NL: As a kid, he was so tired after school, he
would fall asleep right at home, no matter where.

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,360
NL: And he says he practically
didn't have a life outside of school.

14
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,920
HK: What does that mean that his inner rhythm
is not synchronous with the rest of the world?

15
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,980
NL: Our sleep-wake behaviors are
driven by this circadian rhythm within us.

16
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:27,200
NL: Circadian, because the rhythm takes about 24 hours,
sometimes a little longer, sometimes a little shorter.

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,780
NL: The average is about 24.2.

18
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,960
HK: But our world is being timed to an
exact 24-hour rhythm, not a rough one.

19
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,020
NL: That's right.

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:48,400
NL: And this is possible because external factors like daylight, but also
diet and exercise, are adjusting our internal clocks to 24 hours, so to speak.

21
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:57,020
NL: Light is the decisive factor in this, because it affects our most
important internal clock, the subrachiasmatic core in the hypothalamus.

22
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,400
NL: When light hits our retina, signals
from there also reach this very core.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,080
NL: And that then leads to the production of
the sleep hormone melatonin being stopped.

24
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
NL: So we're going to wake up.

25
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,540
NL: But there's a problem now.

26
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,080
NL: This synchronization
doesn't work for all people.

27
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,500
NL: They live in their own time.

28
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:30,700
HK: Good morning or good evening, depending on where
your internal clock is or where you are in the world.

29
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,320
HK: My name is Hella Kemper and I'm going to walk you
through today's episode of the Know-it-Time podcast.

30
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,480
HK: We want to try to
understand sleep better.

31
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,640
HK: We meet people whose
inner clock ticks differently.

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,480
HK: Our author Nina Lennertz
spoke to a sleep specialist.

33
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:57,560
HK: She wanted to know when you stop talking about sleep deprivation,
when it's a real sleep disorder, and what you can do about it.

34
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:05,460
HK: And because many of us are up at night, you get
the best sleeping tips from our author Tobias Hürther.

35
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,520
HK: He's a philosopher, and watched nights
are not entirely foreign to him, I think.

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:16,060
HK: And Christoph Drösser asks in his
Impossible column why some of us turn to sleep.

37
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:32,680
HK: So Nina, the French neuroscientist Stéphane Larroque, is having
trouble adapting his individual day-night rhythm to our 24-hour day.

38
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,320
HK: Sounds like
a very busy life.

39
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,640
NL: Yeah, he's 24 now.

40
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:44,160
NL: Non-24 is a disorder, this circadian
rhythm that's very common in blind people.

41
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,800
NL: But Larroque is not blind.

42
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,620
NL: No, no, he can
see without restrictions.

43
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,460
NL: But that's one
of the rare cases.

44
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,820
NL: Non-24 is much more
common in blind people.

45
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:04,020
NL: According to a 2016 article, up to 70 percent of
blind people who can't see light at all suffer from it.

46
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:11,580
NL: The adjustment of their internal clocks by the light
falls off, meaning their internal rhythm runs independently.

47
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:22,300
NL: If someone has a circadian rhythm of 24.5 hours, for example,
their sleep and wake times shift by 30 minutes every day.

48
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,420
HK: So, in summary, the sleep-wake rhythm of these
people is independent of the outer day-night rhythm.

49
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,620
HK: Sometimes it's okay,
but most of the time it's not.

50
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:46,780
NL: Exactly, so in the example of a 24.5-hour rhythm, it takes 48 days for the
inner rhythm, practically the inner night and the inner day to match the outer.

51
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,980
NL: And then it starts all
over again and moves on.

52
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:59,440
HK: Sounds exhausting to the organism, but let's
get back to the cause of this rhythm disorder.

53
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,640
HK: Non24 is common in blind people, but
Stephen Larroque, as we just said, can see.

54
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,100
NL: Yeah, and for a long time, he
didn't know what was going on with him.

55
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:18,260
NL: Non24 is sometimes not even diagnosed in
blind people, or at least not for a long time.

56
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,620
NL: Stephen Larroque was
diagnosed in his mid-20s.

57
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,720
NL: Why exactly NON24 is now also
present in people who see is still unclear.

58
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,980
NL: Larroque himself
thinks it's genetic.

59
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,320
NL: His father and grandmother were said to have
had a very similar sleep-walking behavior to him.

60
00:05:38,320 --> 00:06:04,400
SL: His friends even joked about his father being a vampire
because he slept behind closed curtains so often during the day.

61
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,140
NL: For a long time, Larroque's
father was unemployed.

62
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,760
NL: That's what happens to a lot of
people in the NON24 community, he says.

63
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:23,140
NL: After all, it's not easy right now to find a job that fits a shifted sleep pattern
or to keep a job that forces you to live permanently against your own internal clock.

64
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,720
HK: And how is that going
with Stephen Larroque himself?

65
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,560
HK: Did his life get
easier after the diagnosis?

66
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:40,020
NL: So for the first time, he actually went on in the big picture as before,
just trying to adjust to the rhythm of his environment, against his inner clock.

67
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:56,160
NL: That meant for him that he couldn't make reliable
plans because he never knew if he might be asleep or tired.

68
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,000
NL: That was very chaotic.

69
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,500
SL: There were a lot of problems, both
with my girlfriend and with the university.

70
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:14,480
SL: When I came to the reading
room, I didn't have to sleep very often.

71
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,540
SL: I didn't have to sleep.

72
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,400
SL: I was not sleeping.

73
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,200
SL: Sometimes I would
sleep when I was reading.

74
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,780
NL: It was hard for his relationship with
his then girlfriend, who he's married to now.

75
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,580
NL: But there were problems with
sleep disturbances in his studies, too.

76
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,100
NL: Sometimes he went to
class without sleeping at all.

77
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,940
NL: Or sometimes he slept while
he was supposed to be in college.

78
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,540
SL: I had a network of
friends who sent me notes.

79
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,900
SL: I had to find strategies
to overcome these problems.

80
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,280
NL: So Larroque had to think of
strategies to live with his shifting pace.

81
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,340
NL: He had, for example,

82
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,860
NL: a network of friends
who wrote for him in college.

83
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,160
NL: Very difficult.

84
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,540
NL: Yeah, that was it.

85
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,260
NL: And it was also very exhausting,
so Larroque had heart problems.

86
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:15,380
NL: He says his heart problems only got better when he
had nights where he could sleep well and for a long time.

87
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,840
NL: So his rhythm was quite in line
with the day-night rhythm of all of us.

88
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:32,300
NL: So Larroque started trying to better control his sleeping and
waking hours and adjust to our normal 24-hour rhythm in quotes.

89
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,520
HK: But how can you do that,
adjust your biological rhythm?

90
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,040
NL: So for completely blind people who are now 24, there's
a sleep remedy that's effective against the disorder.

91
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,160
NL: It's called Tazimelton, but it's not
approved for people who can still perceive light.

92
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,760
NL: So that's not even
true of Steffen Larroque.

93
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,940
NL: He helps himself
primarily with light therapy.

94
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:02,100
NL: When he wakes up, he puts on a device, which is a type
of glasses, that radiates light to his eyes almost all day.

95
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,880
NL: He wore it during
our interview, for example.

96
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,280
NL: At night, he makes sure to
get as much germ light as possible.

97
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,660
NL: He wears them when he has to be out at night,
like a special sunglasses with red glasses.

98
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,160
NL: So everyday things like going to
the movies at night are out of his mind.

99
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,380
HK: So he can't lead a
completely normal life?

100
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,020
NL: No, not quite.

101
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:33,120
NL: But it helps him a lot today to know that it's not about his personality
that he wasn't lazy when he wanted to sleep during the day or had to.

102
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,360
NL: The rhythm disorder is part of
him, but not part of his personality.

103
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,280
NL: He's also been on the internet,
sharing with people who are also now 24.

104
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,880
HK: You're normal
in your abnormality.

105
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
HK: So a sentence that we could all
remember, with or without sleep disorder.

106
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,680
NL: Yeah, that's right, I
think that's very nice to say.

107
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:12,300
NL: And I took something else from the conversation with Steffen
Larroque that I might be able to translate into my own life.

108
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,400
NL: He and his wife have a
rule that I find very charming.

109
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,500
NL: Because you
never fight at night.

110
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,360
NL: When a conflict somehow collapses,
they always postpone it to the next day.

111
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:29,620
NL: Because in the morning, you can better resolve
conflicts, Larroque says, also because of our circadian rhythm.

112
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,360
HK: Yeah, I think
it's a good idea too.

113
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,280
HK: And we all have a
circadian rhythm after all.

114
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,960
HK: And he also determines, for example, whether
we're owls or lizards, so we go to bed early or late.

115
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,260
NL: That's right, the rhythm
is determined by our genetics.

116
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:51,560
NL: So science can even determine if someone
is an owl or a lizard by using a hair sample.

117
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,240
NL: We all have different
preferred bedtime.

118
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,980
NL: And everything in a time window from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.
at most is also quite normal at first, says Ingo Fieze.

119
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,120
NL: He runs the sleep
medicine center at Berlin Charité.

120
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,440
Ingo Fietze: It's in our genes,
it's fixed, it's not changing much.

121
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,540
IF: There are only
two shifts in life.

122
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,440
IF: One is when I was a
teenager, say between 13.

123
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,700
IF: and 19.

124
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,540
IF: Age, I'm going to be an owl automatically,
I prefer to go to bed between 10:00 and 24:00.

125
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,780
IF: And as I get older, I say 55 years,
this rhythm moves back a little bit forward.

126
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,900
HK: Yeah, and what if I like to go to bed
much later, so not between 9:00 and 1:00?

127
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,960
NL: Then there could be a shift forward
or backward of your circadian rhythm.

128
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,400
NL: And then you talk about a circadian
sleep rhythm disorder, like 24 is now a one.

129
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:10,220
IF: When young people say I can only go to bed at two or three, I can't go to bed
before, I can't sleep at all, so we're starting from a shifted sleep rhythm, not a owl.

130
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:18,680
NL: It can happen that the internal rhythm of sleep is genetically engineered
to the point that their biological night always doesn't start until 3:00.

131
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:33,940
NL: However, according to Vize, young people who often have the problem of going to bed very late are much
more likely to postpone their period by sitting at their computer or cell phone until four o'clock at night.

132
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:44,720
NL: Delayed sleep rhythm is also often the problem of shiftworkers or night workers
whose biological sleep rhythm is constantly disturbed by their working hours.

133
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,380
NL: So night becomes day
and day becomes night for them?

134
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:59,040
NL: That's right, you can compare it a little bit to having a jet lag all the time, and then
it's not, or at least it's very difficult to reconcile with being active during the day.

135
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,840
NL: Ingo Vietze gave an example
from his own experience of treatment.

136
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:12,800
IF: Fördner worked the night shift for 30 years, lost his job,
retired to Germany and they said, "You're looking for a new job".

137
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,880
If he didn't find one and the pension
recommended, you'll have to take a day's nap.

138
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:26,940
IF: Did he try it, did he not tolerate it, and then
he came to us and said, "Doctor, what do we do now?"

139
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:42,060
IF: And then I actually wrote him a test that he obviously would not be a day person from being a night person anymore,
because he's been doing that for 30 years and if the German pension is there or the employment agency can't find him a job,

140
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,240
If he wants to be charged.

141
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:54,800
NL: If your body tells you to go to sleep at four o'clock, but you're forced to show up at
work at eight o'clock, you're logically getting too little sleep and then you're also sleeping.

142
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:06,220
IF: The problem today is that we still have too little flexibility in working hours, that young
people who are more likely to go to bed later still have to go to school early at seven or eight.

143
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,040
NL: But not every sleep disorder
is a disturbance of circadian rhythm.

144
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,720
NL: According to Ingo Vieze, these disorders occur,
and then you talk about insomnia, even more often.

145
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,480
NL: People with this condition may
not sleep well or wake up often at night.

146
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:31,080
NL: The reasons can be, for example, mental
illness or a stroke or simply poor sleep hygiene.

147
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,340
HK: Sleep hygiene, so what
would be a good sleep hygiene?

148
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:41,440
NL: For example, it would be good to pay attention
to rest during sleep and to have regular bedtimes.

149
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,500
HK: And when do you know
you have a sleep disorder?

150
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,200
HK: I mean, I can get a bad night's
sleep sometimes, and I know that.

151
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,460
NL: Ingo Vieze has a
relatively simple rule for this.

152
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:08,680
NL: If you have trouble falling asleep or falling asleep at least three times a week and you don't change
it within four to 12 months, even though you're taking care of your sleep hygiene, you should seek help.

153
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,640
NL: After such a long period of sleep problems,
you're talking about chronic sleep disorder.

154
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:23,820
HK: So to prevent this from happening, I'm going to talk to Tobias Hürther,
who's a time science author and has written the book You Are What You Sleep.

155
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,720
HK: He knows some scientifically sound sleep
tips for anyone without adult sleep disorders.

156
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,660
HK: Hi, Tobias. What is it?

157
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,440
I'm going to tell you something.

158
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,800
HK: Tobias, how did
you sleep last night?

159
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,300
TH: In some ways good, so
I've slept enough, eight hours.

160
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,200
TH: I slept a little light, I
had a little bit of deep sleep.

161
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,220
HK: What do you
mean, easy sleep?

162
00:15:46,960 --> 00:16:06,140
TH: Deep sleep is usually in the first, first half of sleep, and there, so the sleep phases are always alternating
in these cycles, and the focus in the first half of sleep is on deep sleep, and that's for some reason,

163
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,060
TH: I don't know, something came up short last
night, tells me the recording of my watch.

164
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,620
HK: What do you pay attention
to when you go to sleep?

165
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:29,180
TH: Regularity, so I'm really trying to go to bed at the same time and
slowly slip into this sleep mode, doing similar things at the same time.

166
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,020
HK: And does it mean you
always wake up at the same time?

167
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:40,680
TH: So that's the best way to do it, which is, of course, not always,
depending on how the day goes, what's coming, but that's part of it.

168
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,920
HK: Can you actually go to bed
or go to bed, so get some sleep?

169
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,060
TH: Unfortunately, you
can't sleep in advance.

170
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:56,180
TH: You can't sleep on supplies, which I think is great
and practical, but unfortunately it's not possible.

171
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:05,160
TH: The regeneration processes have to come after what we've been burdened
with, so you can't sleep in advance, unfortunately, unfortunately.

172
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,920
HK: But can you
go back to sleep?

173
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:21,600
TH: You can get that back to a certain degree, but then of course you've spent some time in sleep deprivation,
which is not that healthy, but obviously, so if you have a sleep deprivation, you can catch up, yeah.

174
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:30,300
HK: Well, in couples, the thing is, we'd rather sleep
apart, so each for himself or for two, do you agree?

175
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:53,340
TH: So sleep is very individual, so I think I have an opinion for myself, I like to sleep in pairs, although it has disadvantages, but some people
are more sensitive to it, and it can also make sense to sleep separately, so as with many questions about sleep, the answer is usually individual.

176
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:07,880
HK: And you have kids, too, I don't know how old they are, how are you doing with
younger kids, how do you do it right as a parent, so that they learn healthy, good sleep?

177
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:28,320
TH: So our youngest child is ten and then he's out of the deepest sleep, but it's known, anecdotally, I know that, and it's also
been proven by studies that parents of young children typically have extreme sleep deficits, which is unfortunately the case.

178
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:39,100
TH: So there's a new study that says it can take six years
for parents to get back to their healthy sleep pattern.

179
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:51,400
TH: So for the first time, it's normal and important to stay calm about all
this, because if you're stressed out, it's easily passed on to the child.

180
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:57,400
TH: Because you say couples, it's really important
to switch, which takes a lot of pressure off.

181
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:05,580
TH: It's also known that still mothers
sleep significantly less than fathers.

182
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,020
TH: I can confirm that.

183
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,600
TH: And it's really a
huge relief to be switching.

184
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,880
HK: But my question
was more about the kids.

185
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:24,020
HK: So how do you teach kids to sleep well, to
get through their sleep as soon as possible?

186
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,360
HK: I always liked to read to
my child before bed at night.

187
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,680
HK: I think that's
recognized as good, right?

188
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,660
TH: Yes, that's right.

189
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:33,840
TH: Rituals.

190
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,420
TH: Rituals are great.

191
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,580
TH: So sleep has a
lot to do with regularity.

192
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:47,820
TH: So unfortunately, we can't sleep on command, so
we can eat on command or we can strain our muscles.

193
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:56,120
TH: But we can use our habits
program in the brain to find sleep.

194
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:05,020
HK: Do you know of any phases in your life where you suddenly
find it harder to fall asleep or even get a good night's sleep?

195
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,940
TH: Yes, yes.

196
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:12,440
TH: So if you're upset inside,
if you're busy with something.

197
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:18,820
TH: That's often the first
indication that something's wrong.

198
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,900
TH: I'm most likely to
notice this in my sleep.

199
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,180
HK: So what are you doing?

200
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,560
TH: Well, I'm thinking about
what this might be about.

201
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,960
TH: What's driving me?

202
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,860
HK: And how important
are external factors?

203
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:39,120
HK: So fresh air, open windows, not
too hot, turn down heating, dark enough.

204
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,360
HK: Is that really
that important?

205
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,740
TH: Yes, that's important.

206
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,860
TH: Being able to sleep
well is just about hormones.

207
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:59,300
TH: And if you give your body the signal that it's actually a bright day, through
bright or very energetic light, then you can't expect it to fall asleep easily.

208
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:08,880
TH: So that means that in time, the lighting dims a little bit, you put the
buzzing devices away a little bit, and you lower the temperature in the bedroom.

209
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,420
TH: So the optimal temperature for sleeping
is all naturally studied, is amazingly low.

210
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,420
HK: How much is it?

211
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,000
TH: So it can be 15 degrees.

212
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,400
TH: I actually think the best interval is
somewhere between 13 and 17 degrees.

213
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,140
TH: So that's significantly below the
temperature we normally have in our homes.

214
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:34,620
HK: So I also opened the window halfway and
turned the heater down, but I have a little tick.

215
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,360
HK: I sleep under
three blankets.

216
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,840
HK: Is that bad?

217
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:46,200
TH: It's also known that a thick blanket that exerts a little bit of pressure,
so to speak, but it creates a sense of security that helps you sleep.

218
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,880
TH: That's been studied.

219
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,520
HK: Tobias, you're also a great runner
and I think you're a mountain climber.

220
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:00,360
HK: And do you actually spend
nights outside in tents or even outdoors?

221
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,340
TH: Not in the open air anymore,
but I like to spend nights outdoors.

222
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,560
HK: What's so
beautiful about that?

223
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:20,220
TH: You don't necessarily sleep best, but it's just wonderful
to be awakened by sunrise or by birds, and it's wonderful.

224
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,720
TH: So I like to sleep
in the mountains.

225
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,760
HK: Tobias, thank
you for your tips.

226
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,560
HK: The seven best sleep aids you've described
in the current edition of Time Knowledge.

227
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,280
HK: And that's where our
new series starts overnight.

228
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,940
HK: We explain why people think,
feel, and function differently at night.

229
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,000
HK: Which we can't explain.

230
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,380
HK: The impossible
column by Christoph Drösser.

231
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,120
Christoph Drösser: Today, why
do some people walk in their sleep?

232
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:17,540
CD: The sleepwalker walking through the apartment with his arms
outstretched and his eyes closed is a popular comic book cliché.

233
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:25,360
CD: In reality, sleepwalkers behave almost normally, at least
their gaze is a little stiff and their movements are uncertain.

234
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,380
CD: And when they wake up,
they don't remember anything.

235
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,580
HK: The problem is.

236
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,640
CD: On the one hand, sleepwalkers are
sleeping, their consciousness is turned off.

237
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,580
CD: On the other hand,
they're behaving like a vigilante.

238
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,020
CD: How did this strange state of intermittent
disorder, also called parasomnia, come about?

239
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,460
SL: Which we already know.

240
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:59,480
CD: You can't cause sleepwalking to happen on purpose,
because it's similar to physical phenomena like swallowing.

241
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,880
CD: So you can hardly test
it in a sleep lab, for example.

242
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:09,140
CD: And because the sleepwalkers don't remember their
nightly episodes later, there are no exact numbers.

243
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:19,340
CD: A review study estimates that 5% of all children and 1.5% of all
adults have experienced a sleep change episode in the last 12 months.

244
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,080
CD: Sleepwalking occurs in the deep sleep
phase, not in the REM sleep we dream of.

245
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:31,980
CD: The episodes can last up to half an hour, and the
affected persons may perform some of the most complex tasks.

246
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,120
CD: A lot of people are
making something to eat.

247
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:42,020
CD: And an American sleepwalker drove 23 kilometers
to his mother-in-law, who he then killed.

248
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,980
CD: But most sleep transformers
don't pose a risk to outsiders.

249
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,920
CD: And the full moon has
nothing to do with sleepwalking.

250
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,060
CD: There are a few factors
that favor sleep change.

251
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:06,960
CD: The common sleep patterns of children as adults may have
something to do with their brain not being fully developed.

252
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,980
CD: There is a
distinct genetic factor.

253
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,760
CD: Children with two parents who are sleepwalking are
three times more likely to be affected than others.

254
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:25,780
CD: Mental illness promotes sleep patterns, and it occurs four to six times more
often in people with migraines and Tourette syndrome than in the general population.

255
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,460
CD: Sleep deprivation and chronic
fatigue seem to favor the phenomenon.

256
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,300
CD: Especially children often go
to sleep when they have a fever.

257
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,480
CD: And in women, the frequency
fluctuates with the menstrual cycle.

258
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,620
CD: But these are all
statistical statements.

259
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,520
CD: How all these conditions actually affect the brain
and disrupt the wake mechanism, science can't tell.

260
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,440
CD: There are no clinical
studies on sleepwalking.

261
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,460
CD: Sleepwalking is not
really a disease, either.

262
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,060
CD: The only negative consequences are
accidents that happen during night trips.

263
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:07,420
CD: Well, that's probably why there's not a lot of research on this
phenomenon, and it's also because the causes of sleep change are unclear.

264
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:14,000
CD: One more thing, if you live with a
sleepwalker, don't wake him or her up brutally.

265
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,700
CD: It confuses
the people involved.

266
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,100
CD: Take the person carefully by the
shoulder and lead them back to bed.

267
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,160
CD: Then you
usually fall asleep.

268
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,540
HK: In the current Time Science issue, I'd like
to recommend two more pieces for the night.

269
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,780
HK: Nils Böhing reports on his trip
through Europe in three-night trains.

270
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:44,540
HK: And what's definitely helping
with poor sleep is winter bathing.

271
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,440
HK: If you dive in two degrees of cold water,
you're guaranteed to be tired at night.

272
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:58,640
HK: You can get a free trial of the Time Know
Magazine at time.de slash know minus podcast.

273
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,740
HK: And we're excited
about feedback and ideas.

274
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:07,560
HK: Please write to us at podcast

275
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,020

Kemper and I'll see you soon.
