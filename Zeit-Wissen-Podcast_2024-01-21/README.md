How the subtitles were generated:

* Transcription with multi-speakers diarization made with Faster Whisper, whisper-large-v2 model, with pyannote_v3.1.
* Manual re-identification of speakers.
* Translation using nllb-serve and subtitle edit, with manual changes in post-process to fix missing names and a few incorrect translations.

Done in November 2024.

The German transcription and the English translation are unofficial, they are not endorsed by the Zeit Wissen, and there is no guarantee of accuracy nor of correctness that they reflect faithfully the original content, it is only provided for information as a courtesy.
