# spotlight
A repository for documents and links related to media coverage and other works featuring our collective's journey and creative endeavors.

All documents remain the property of their original authors (even when they are semi-automated transcription and translations), unless otherwise explicitly stated.

Hence don't expect the content here to be open-source. We cannot do that. We only reproduce here documents we are kindly allowed to.
